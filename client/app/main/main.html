      <p>IdeaPrairie offers its users an unprecedented way to obtain market research. Rather than ask a focus group for problems, IdeaPrairie focuses on asking its community for solutions. By building a platform that brings together mass amounts of innovative minds we have built the world’s largest think tank. Users post ideas for feedback and validation from the masses. For a more in depth look at what the market wants, companies can directly ask the community using the contest feature. IdeaPrairie harnesses the market like no other by allowing anyone to post, comment, and vote.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>A forum for brainstorming. Post your ideas and comment on others. By helping to grow the community through constructive discussion and collaboration, ideas, such as your own will flourish.</p>
      <p>Contests enable businesses to utilize the extensive community by incentivizing them to generate new ideas and better business practices with a bit of prize money. As a basic user, by offering up useful and insightful ideas, you have the chance to win that prize money!</p>
      <p>IdeaPrairie’s community is open to everyone. Users not only gain more feedback, but also capitalize on the opportunity for brand promotion. Other platforms build limited communities, where a business can only use its existing user base.</p>

  <div class="col-md-3 faq-title">WON’T PEOPLE STEAL IDEAS?</div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>It would be the same as going on T.V. or taking out an ad to promote your idea. We do offer some layers of protection within our Terms of Use. We also offer a fixed date and time stamp to give you proof of when you created the idea. However, nothing is more secure than a patent and even those aren’t perfect. If you have something that is truly proprietary, patentable, and you have every intention of filing for that patent, we recommend you keep the “secret sauce” to yourself.</p>

  <div class="col-md-3 faq-title">HOW DO MY IDEAS GET EXPOSURE?</div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Custom algorithms ensure your ideas are seen not only by the people who support you but also by the people whom you support. The more people you support, the more support you will get in return.</p>

  <div class="col-md-3 faq-title">IS THERE A COST FOR BEING A MEMBER?</div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Nope, Basic membership is free! Commercial membership, however, has a monthly fee. We gotta pay the bills somehow.</p>

  <div class="col-md-3 faq-title">WHAT PERKS DO I GET WITH COMMERCIAL MEMBERSHIP?</div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Commercial members have the ability to host a contest, a way of receiving very targeted and useful feedback and brainstorming from customers. Along with that, you will also be given access to more advanced feedback metrics than what is available to basic members.</p>
